	Abstract = {Data-independent Memory Hard Functions (iMHFS) are finding a growing number of applications in security; especially in the domain of password hashing. An important property of a concrete iMHF is specified by fixing a directed acyclic graph (DAG)                                                                                   {\$}{\$}G{\_}n{\$}{\$}                   on n nodes. The quality of that iMHF is then captured by the following two pebbling complexities of                                                                                   {\$}{\$}G{\_}n{\$}{\$}                  :                                          The parallel cumulative pebbling complexity                                                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varPi ^{\{}{\backslash}parallel {\}}{\_}{\{}cc{\}}(G{\_}n){\$}{\$}                         must be as high as possible (to ensure that the amortized cost of computing the function on dedicated hardware is dominated by the cost of memory).                                                              The sequential space-time pebbling complexity                                                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varPi {\_}{\{}st{\}}(G{\_}n){\$}{\$}                         should be as close as possible to                                                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varPi ^{\{}{\backslash}parallel {\}}{\_}{\{}cc{\}}(G{\_}n){\$}{\$}                         (to ensure that using many cores in parallel and amortizing over many instances does not give much of an advantage).                                      },
